# GRADIEND: Monosemantic Feature Learning within Neural Networks Applied to Gender Debiasing of Transformer Models

This repository contains the official source code for the training and evaluation of [GRADIEND: Monosemantic Feature Learning within Neural Networks Applied to Gender Debiasing](todo).
Further evaluations of this study can be reproduced using our expanded version of bias-bench.

## Install
```bash
git clone anonymous
cd model_with_gradiend
conda create --file environment.yml
conda activate model_with_gradiend
```

Download [Gendered Words](https://github.com/ecmonsen/gendered_words) and copy the file into the `data/` directory of this repository.

Optional: Install our `bias-bench` for further evaluations and comparison to other debiasing techniques.

## Overview

Package | Description
--------|------------
`gradiend.model` | GRADIEND model implementation
`gradiend.data` | Data generation and access
`gradiend.training` | Training of GRADIEND
`gradiend.evaluation` | Evaluation of GRADIEND
`gradiend.export` | Export functions for results, e.g., printing LaTeX tables and plotting images

> **__NOTE:__** All python files of this repository should be called from the root directory of the project to ensure that the correct (relative) paths are used (.e.g., `python gradiend/training/gradiend_training.py`).

See `demo.ipynb` for a quick overview of the GRADIEND model and the evaluation process.

### Data
The `gradiend.data` package provides two purposes:
- Data access: The relevant datasets can be accessed via the `read_[dataset]()` functions, i.e., `read_genter()`, `read_geneutral()`, `read_namexact()`, `read_namextend()`, and `read_gentypes()`.
- Data generation: The generation process of these datasets is not necessary for the GRADIEND training (as the datasets are already generated), but the code is still available in the `data` package (see below *Dataset Generation*).

### Training

The training of the GRADIEND models is done by running the `gradiend.training.gradiend_training` script, which will train three GRADIENDs for each considered base model (`bert-base-cased`, `bert-large-cased`, `distilbert-base-cased`, `roberta-large`), selecting the best model at the end.
Intermediate results are saved in `results/experiments/gradiend`, and the final models are saved in `results/models`.
The `gradiend_training` script relies on:
- `gradiend.training.data`: the `TrainingDataset` class combines several datasets (e.g., GENTER, NAMEXACT, ...) and contains  the logic to create appropriate training data during the training, i.e., matching a GENTER template sentence with a name of a certain gender and computing the tokens. 
- `gradiend.training.trainer`: the `train()` function trains a single GRADIEND model and provides many hyperparameters

### Evaluation

#### Analysis of Encoder
The `gradiend.evaluation.analyze_encoder.analyze()` function analyzes the encoder of a trained GRADIEND model with three dataset:

- GENTER as in the training process
- GENTER with correctly filled template tokens, and with masked tokens that are gender-neutral
- GENEUTRAL

This function can be easily called for multiple models by calling `gradiend.evaluation.analyze_encoder.analyze_models(*models)`. The raw results are saved in the same base folder as the GRADIEND model (e.g., `results/models/bert-base-cased_params_spl_test.csv`). 
Then, the model metrics can be generated and printed by calling `gradiend.evaluation.analyze_encoder.print_all_models()`.

#### Analysis of Decoder and Generation of (De-)Biased Models

`gradiend.evaluation.analyze_decoder.default_evaluation()` evaluates the decoder of a trained GRADIEND model by generating debiased models for different learning rates and gender factors.
The evaluation results are cached per learning rate and gender factor (`results/cache/decoder`), and plots are shown visualizing the results.

The best debiased, male-biased, and female-biased models according to this evaluation can be generated by executing the `gradiend.evaluation.select_models` script, which saves these models into `results/changed_models`. The models are names `[base model]-[type]`, with type being `N` for the debiased model, `F` for the female model, and `M` for the male model.

Some basic evaluations of these debiased models can be done by calling:
- `analyze_decoder.evaluate_all_gender_predictions()` and `export/gender_predictions.py` for an overfitting analysis
- `export/example_predictions.py` to generate example predictions

### Evaluation of (De-)Biased Models
See bias-bench for a comparison of the (de-)biased models generated with GRADIEND to other debiasing techniques.

### Export
The export package contains functions to export the results of the evaluations, e.g., to print LaTeX tables or to plot images.

Script | Description
-------|------------
`dataset_stats` | prints the statistics of the datasets used in the paper
`encoder_plot` | Plots a violin plot regarding the distribution of encoded values of the encoder analysis
`changed_model_selection` | Generates a table with the statistics of the selected (de-) biased models (from `gradiend.evaluation.analyze_decoder.default_evaluation()`
`gender_predictions` | Plots predicted female and male probabilities for simple masking task to evaluate overfitting
`example_predictions` | Generates example predictions for the selected (de-) biased as a LaTeX table


## Dataset Generation

Although the experiments mentioned above are based on pre-generated data, we also provide the code to 
generate the datasets used in the paper.
